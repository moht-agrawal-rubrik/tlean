    "long_summary": "[Investigating] TOTVS S.A. is experiencing 2500+ 504 Gateway Timeout errors after migrating from REST API to GraphQL, impacting automated workflows and causing failed queries/mutations. Although backend API calls eventually succeed, extended response times (>10 minutes) trigger 504 errors, leading to incorrect host status in customer automation scripts. Multiple clusters are affected. Priority is P1; root cause appears to be cluster overload post-migration. Mitigation options and alternative status polling are being discussed.",
